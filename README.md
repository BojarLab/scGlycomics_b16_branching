# Deep Learning Explains the Biology of Branched Glycans from Single-Cell Sequencing Data

This repository contains the code and the trained model from our recent preprint "Deep Learning Explains the Biology of Branched Glycans from Single-Cell Sequencing Data" (Qin et al., 2022). In this work, we demonstrate a method to gain insight into the multimodal role of glycans by analyzing paired single-cell transcriptomics data and lectin-sequencing via a dedicated deep learning model.
